# Platformer thing

*Damn why do I always make these logos*

# Whats "Platformer thing"?

Platformer thing is literally something I made in Code.org during my free time in class... nothing much more to
say other then it being a test demo.

# Why use Code.org?

**I ask the same question as you**

The reason I used it is because thats the only thing I had available during school time. Literally couple days ago, I found my old Code.org projects from 8th grade and I thought of using it again but for... this...

# Are you going to expand on this?

Eh... I would definetly like to make a sidescroller platformer one day. If I were to do that, I would definetly use a different engine then... this... If you mean to expand on this version specfically, no, never.

# Why dosnt stage 4 end?

... Not even I know... I guess I forgot...

# How can I play this?

Simply copy and paste the code to a new code.org project. There.

# How can I play this part 2/Can I put this on my own site? :))))))))))))))))

Paste this line to your html page. Its just a basic embed though so if you want to add detail, you have to do that yourself.

# Why is there a stage 5 and 6?

I added it to test out on random colors. They arent real stages so I guess you could consider them "Encore" or "Bootleg" stages since they are pretty much copies of stage 3 and 1 respectivly. 

# Will you ever release your other Code.org projects?

I might...

# Can I modify this project?

Hell yeah go ahead, I suck at using code.org anyways.

# Lists of problems

*(Note: As I said earlier, no I won't expand on this so don't expect these to be fixed.)*

1. It was made using Code.org
2. You can grab onto the sides of a platform and still jump up... I tried to fix it but didnt fell bothered to and I used it to the levels. I guess its one of those "bug that became a feature".
3. Literally the shooting is pointless
4. If health reaches 0, you automatically game over instead of simply losing a life.
5. HUD dosnt follow the camera when camera is moving.
6. The mounatin in "stage 3"
7. You can't jump on the "gem platform" (seriously, how did I screw that up-)
8. Stage 4 simply never ends
9. The level select is kind of broken, you can easily switch the first 4 stages but when you enter stage 5 and 6, the game just breaks
(Mostly because they arent real levels and just recolors of stage 1 and 3.)

anyways enjoy... i guess...
